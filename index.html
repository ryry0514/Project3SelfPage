    <h1><em>Soul Mate</em></h1>
    <p>
      I remember the first time i saw this beatuful woman. Believe it or not its been 10 years. She was wearing a back brace, she was just released from the hospital after surgery from a wrech she had got in. We met in a recovery group, she had nodded off while driving. Even with that back brace i had this inner desire i hadn't had before. I wanted her, i had to have her, i would do anything. Sure enough it took about 3-4 months but i finally got my claws in her. I have never told her this, but i met Mallory at a crucial time. I was overwelmed with feelings of failure and worthlessness. I was suicidal and using drugs, not a good combination. I know my life would be extremely different today,and i progbably wouldnt alive. I had a choice after i met Mallory, go to a recovery center where she was at with my sister in ST Loiuis or go to Atlanta where my brother was at. If i never met Mallory those couple days before making my decision i wouldn't have chose St Louis. </p></div>

    <h2>Never Felt This Way Before</h2>
      <small>After Ten years i have no desire to sleep with or be with anyone else. This is foreign for me, before Mal the longest relationshiop i had ever had was 4 months. I still can't believe it, sometimes i think that she put a spell on me. As long as she wants to be with me i guess leave that spell on girl. She was by far the best sex i have had period. The way that she taste when i went down on her was sweet life fruit, but like no fruit i had ever had before. It was so much more delicious. I craved it, like a vampire for blood. The forbidden fruit in the garden Adam and Eve ate, I am guessing it tasted like that. But the sex was only an extreme benefit to our relationship. I actually got to know her for 6 months before we even kissed. I cared so much about her then, i didnt want to fuck with her emotiuons as she was trying to kick her heroin habbit. Ten fucking years has gone by and i wouldn't have wanted to spend them any other way</small></div>

     <h3>How Life Complecates Things</h3>
    <p>2019 was the worst year of my life. Towards the end of 2018 I had thousands of dollars stolen from me. I do not, especially then, make much money so this was a devastating blow. My Mother let Mallory and My daughter Layla move into her 7 bedroom massive house. I will never forgive her for treating me as she did. I was not allowed to stay with my family, instead i went to a homeless shelter. 45 minutes away I had to live because it was winter and fucking cold. Mallory didnt want to leave me and came with me to the shelter at first, Layla got sick so she had no choice but to stay at my moms. I had to live that couple months without them, and man did it tear me up. Mallory and Layla moved back in with me, and 3 months goes by and i get pulled over. I find out i have a warrant in missouri 2 hours away. They take me to jail without even calling or telling Mallory. I was in their for 2 weeks wondering what Mallory was doing hoping she was still at my house. Come to find out she had moved back in with my mom. I dont blame her I either need to get my shit together or life is just being cruel or karma was catching up to me. </p></div></br>

    <h4>Time Will Tell</h4>
      <p>My sister was shot and killed in November 2019 and that was devastating for me. I didnt want anything to do with anybody even Mallory. I dont konw if this is where it happpened but it seems as if she is trying not to have feelings for me. She has to be denying them to herself because she doesnt want to feel them. Right? I really don't know anymore. We have a child together and I know that she does love me. However the intimacy is gone, she has no desire to live with me, or sleep with me. Reality has never hit me so fucking hard. I am a fucking mess. The last bender i went on I swear almost took my life. I saw Ashley towards the end, and was shooting methamphetamine and heroin and i was on day 9. Thank God i had a moment of realization when i was trying to take the last shot. I didn't take it and i think taht is why I am alive. Boy was i sick as fuck after that. My arms had nefver ached so bad, and it was all the way down in my joints. The funny bone hot is hruts when you hit it,it was likek that but radiating and all down my arms and even legs cause i shoot their also.<em>I can't stop thinkning have i really fucked this up, Did i seriously lose my soul mate.</em> I have a plan in action now but i dont know if she is going to wait around for it. And i dont blame her if she thinks i wont be able to do it. Kenzie Academy software engineering program I start April 28th and its a year long. After that i will never have to worry about finances like i have, again. I hope she will be around to enjoy it with me. </p>
